Retrieving multiple values within a single column

You can retrieve multiple values together within this single 
column by concatenating the values together. You can include a separator to let you distinguish 
the combined values. For example, on Oracle you could submit the input: 
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
 This uses the double-pipe sequence || which is a string concatenation 
operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates together the values of the username and password fields, separated by the ~ character.

The results from the query contain all the usernames and passwords,


    Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.

    Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query and which columns contain text data. Verify that the query is returning two columns, only one of which contain text, using a payload like the following in the category parameter:
    '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'abc'--

    Use the following payload to retrieve the contents of the users table:
    '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+FROM+users--
    Verify that the application's response contains usernames and passwords.
